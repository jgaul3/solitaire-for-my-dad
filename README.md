# Solitaire for my dad

This is the game, Spider Solitaire, built for my dad. Anyone else can play it but I will only take feature requests if they are from my dad.

An experiment in vibe coding.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This starts a local Vite dev server with hot reload.

## Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Output goes to `dist/`.
